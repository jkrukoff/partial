### Overview ###

![Graph Animation](doc/graph.gif)

The digraph_export module provides a set of utility functions for converting
digraph graphs into common graph file formats. In addition, graph viewing
programs can be launched to view those files.

It is intended for use in debugging and visualizing graphs, not for
customizing the export process. As such, no graph features beyond digraph's
built in ID and label constructs are supported.


### Usage ###

```

1> Graph = digraph:new(),
    digraph:add_vertex(Graph, 1, first),
    digraph:add_vertex(Graph, 2, second),
    digraph:add_edge(Graph, edge, 1, 2, connected).
2> GraphML = digraph_export:convert(Graph, graphml).
3> digraph_export:view(GraphML, graphml, cytoscape).
```

* [graphml](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/)



#### Programs ####

The application has only been tested with Erlang/OTP 21 on Windows 10. Reports
of success (or failure!) on other versions and operating systems are
appreciated.


### Lineage ###

This module was created while working on an [exercism.io
erlang exercise](https://exercism.io/tracks/erlang/exercises/connect/solutions/caf32f0478c442dcb4e77db024c5d375), where I had managed to incorrectly create the underlying
graph. Once I finally found the bug, I realized it would have been quite a bit
easier if I'd been able to visualize the graph I'd created.
